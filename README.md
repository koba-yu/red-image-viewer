## Usage

Set a folder path where images you want to see are placed and click the `load` button.  
Click `prev` or `next` to go to another page(`p` and `n` are assigned access keys for those functions).  
When you want to change how many images to be shown, click the `config` button and change the property values, as the gif above shows.
